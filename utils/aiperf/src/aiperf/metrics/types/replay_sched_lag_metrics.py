"""Replay schedule send-lag metrics (offered vs. actual send-time fidelity).

In fixed-schedule trace replay, every absolutely-scheduled turn carries its
intended (offered) send time in ``Turn.timestamp`` (milliseconds relative to
the schedule zero), and the worker stamps ``RequestRecord.timestamp_ns``
(wall clock) when the request is dispatched to the transport. Their
difference is the per-request send offset. The wall-clock instant of the
schedule zero is not recorded anywhere, so the offset's absolute value is
meaningless post-hoc; lag is therefore reported relative to the least-late
request of the run::

    lag_i = offset_i - min(offset)

What this measures: the dispersion of send lag across the run. Schedule
degradation (event-loop stalls, worker saturation, queue buildup) shows up
as growing lag percentiles.

What this cannot measure:
- A constant delay applied uniformly to every request: anchoring makes the
  least-late request define zero, so a run-wide constant lateness is
  invisible.
- Lag of delay-scheduled continuation turns: under back-pressure replay they
  fire relative to the prior turn's completion, carry no absolute intended
  time (``Turn.timestamp is None``), and are excluded.
- Pure scheduler infidelity for continuation turns in non-strict open-loop
  mode: they keep absolute intended times, but fixed_schedule only dispatches
  them after the prior turn's credit returns, so their lag also includes
  prior-turn service time. The values are still honest send lateness against
  the recorded schedule.
- True wire time: ``timestamp_ns`` is stamped worker-side at transport
  dispatch, before the TCP write.

The derived family is run-scoped (``timeslice_derivable = False``): with
``--slice-duration``, it is excluded from per-slice timeslice derivation,
because re-anchoring each slice at its own least-late request would erase the
cumulative schedule drift these metrics exist to expose.
