    One record per request, produced by an engine-specific
    ``SpecDecodeAdapterProtocol`` (e.g. the vLLM adapter) from a raw response
    payload and consumed only by the metrics layer, which never learns which
    engine produced it. Kept tree-agnostic (an aggregate histogram, not
    per-draft-position data that would encode a tree's parent/child structure)
    and adaptive-safe (no fixed ``k`` assumption) so it survives variable-length
    drafting such as DSpark-style adaptive verification.

    The optional ``per_step_*`` arrays are ordered one-entry-per-verify-step
    sequences -- a temporal axis, still tree-agnostic. They are populated only
    when the source engine reports per-step data and stay ``None`` otherwise, so
    downstream metrics must treat them as best-effort.
