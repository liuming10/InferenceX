"""Utilities for unregistering multiprocessing semaphores from the resource tracker.

When a process exits via os._exit(), garbage collection is skipped, so semaphores
created by multiprocessing.Lock/RLock/Queue are never properly released. The
resource tracker then warns about "leaked semaphore objects". These helpers
explicitly unregister semaphores before os._exit() to suppress those warnings.

Only applies to macOS where named POSIX semaphores (sem_open) are used.
On Linux, semaphores are anonymous (SEM_PRIVATE) with name=None and are not
tracked by the resource tracker, so unregistration is a no-op.
