    """Render a session swim-lane PNG for one or more AIPerf run directories.

    Each run directory must contain ``profile_export.jsonl``. The neighboring
    ``profile_export_aiperf.json`` (when present) is used to draw ramp-done and
    benchmark-end axvlines. Output defaults to ``<run_dir>/swim_lane.png``.

    Examples:
        # Plot a single run, writing to <run_dir>/swim_lane.png
        aiperf analyze swim-lane ./artifacts/my-run/

        # Multiple runs in one invocation
        aiperf analyze swim-lane ./artifacts/run_a/ ./artifacts/run_b/

        # Single run with explicit output path
        aiperf analyze swim-lane ./artifacts/my-run/ -o /tmp/lanes.png

        # Draw a target-concurrency reference line in the bottom panel
        aiperf analyze swim-lane ./artifacts/my-run/ -c 32

        # Also write an interactive HTML trace viewer next to the PNG
        aiperf analyze swim-lane ./artifacts/my-run/ --html

    Args:
        run_dirs: One or more AIPerf run directories.
        out: Output PNG path. Only valid when a single run directory is given.
        concurrency: Target concurrency to draw as a reference line in the
            concurrency panel.
        ramp: Ramp duration in seconds for the ramp-done marker; overrides the
            value read from ``profile_export_aiperf.json`` (useful when only
            the jsonl was exported).
        html: Also write an interactive HTML trace viewer (``swim_lane.html``,
            or the ``--out`` path with an ``.html`` suffix).
