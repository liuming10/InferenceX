class AsyncSSEStreamReader:
    """Parse Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream with per-message timestamps.

    Parsing logic based on the official HTML SSE Living Standard:
    https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#parsing-an-event-stream

    This class can be used to read an SSE stream incrementally, parsing individual messages
    as they arrive from the server. Each message will receive its own timestamp for
    accurate Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and Inter-Chunk-Latency (ICL) measurements.

    SSE Format:
        Server-Sent Events are text-based, with messages delimited by double newlines.
        Supports both \n\n and \r\n\r\n delimiters:

        data: {"id":"chatcmpl-1","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1749678185,"model":"gpt2","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"Hello","tool_calls":[]}}]}

        data: {"id":"chatcmpl-2","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1749678185,"model":"gpt2","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":" World","tool_calls":[]},"finish_reason":"length"}]}

        data: [DONE]

    Parsing Strategy:
        1. Read response in chunks
        2. Accumulate chunks in buffer until delimiter found (\n\n or \r\n\r\n)
        3. Parse complete message using SSEMessage.parse()
        4. Timestamp message at arrival time
        5. Repeat until stream ends

    Args:
        async_iter: Async iterator that yields bytes objects of the raw SSE message.

    Returns:
        Async iterator of SSEMessage objects, each containing:
            - perf_ns: Timestamp when message arrived (nanoseconds)
            - packets: List of SSEField objects, each containing:
                - name: Name of the field (e.g. "data", "event", "id", "retry", "comment")
                - value: Value of the field

    Memory Efficiency:
        The buffer is trimmed after each message is parsed, keeping memory usage
        bounded even for very long SSE streams. Peak memory is approximately:
            buffer_size + chunk_size ≈ typical_message_size + async_iter chunk size

    Error Handling:
        - Unicode decode errors use 'replace' strategy (invalid bytes -> �)
        - Malformed messages are parsed as-is (SSEMessage.parse is permissive, so it will not raise an exception)
        - Empty messages are skipped

    Performance:
        - Incremental parsing minimizes latency (messages available as they arrive)
        - Chunk-based reading is memory efficient
        - Per-message timestamps enable accurate token-level timing
