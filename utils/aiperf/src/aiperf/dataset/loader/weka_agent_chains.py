"""Flattened-agent chain detection for Weka traces via hash_id LCP evidence.

Untagged agent fan-outs (Workflow agents, headerless subagents) are recorded
as interleaved flat top-level requests. This module partitions a trace's
top-level requests back into per-agent chains and classifies every hash-list
divergence as either a join seam (the same agent continuing after a context
edit such as compaction) or a spawn (a new agent forked from a shared
prefix).

Seam-vs-spawn rule: on a shrink — a request sharing only a proper prefix of
its best-matching chain tail — the request is the same agent's continuation
(join seam) iff no future request ever pulls back to the longer, pre-shrink
state; otherwise it is a separate spawned agent. Implemented offline:
phase 1 builds chains greedily, forking on every shrink; phase 2 splices the
elected continuation back onto tails whose longer state turned out to be
dead. A deeper sibling fork from the same tail IS the "future pullback"
that demotes shallower forks to spawns, so the election encodes the rule
directly.

Same-model rule: a chain is only ever continued — by extension or by seam
splice — by requests of the SAME model. Cross-model attachment is always a
spawn, even on a full-prefix match (a Haiku worker reading Opus context is
a different agent; the rare mid-session /model switch is accepted as a
split).

      Opus agent) regardless of payload size; or
    - **small fresh context**: the first request's input length is below
      ``max(isl_floor, isl_ratio * main_peak_isl)`` -- small both absolutely and

       a busy trace into one blob (a long-running chain of overlaps spans the
       whole session).
    2. **Temporal overlap within the scope**: within each fork-point bucket,
       split into connected components of overlapping ``[t0, t1)`` intervals
       (``t0`` = first request time, ``t1`` = latest request-interval end). This
       drops members that share the fork point but never actually run

       beside) -- the group is a concurrent swarm, not a session-wide lineage
       (the failure of keying on ``hash_ids[0]``).

    - **group**: a (fork-point, overlap-component) with at least ``group_min``

    Chains are grouped by fork ancestry into namespace groups (each
    zero-depth fork roots a new group). Per group, the observed prefix is
    the LCP over members' first-request hash lists (0 for singletons).
    The main chain keeps the LONGER of declared vs observed; other chains
    use observed — they only prove the shared region, anything past it is
    not common to the group.
