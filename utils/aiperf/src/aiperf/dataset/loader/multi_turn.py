class MultiTurnDatasetLoader(BaseFileLoader, MediaConversionMixin):
    """A dataset loader that loads multi-turn data from a file.

    The multi-turn type
      - supports multi-modal data (e.g. text, image, audio)
      - supports multi-turn features (e.g. delay, sessions, etc.)
      - supports client-side batching for each data (e.g. batch_size > 1)

    NOTE: If the user specifies multiple multi-turn entries with same session ID,
    the loader will group them together. If the timestamps are specified, they will
    be sorted in ascending order later in the timing manager.

    Examples:
    1. Simple version
    ```json
    {
        "session_id": "session_123",
        "turns": [
            {"text": "Hello", "image": "url", "delay": 0},
            {"text": "Hi there", "delay": 1000}
        ]
    }
    ```

    2. Batched version
    ```json
    {
        "session_id": "session_123",
        "turns": [
            {"texts": ["Who are you?", "Hello world"], "images": ["/path/1.png", "/path/2.png"]},
            {"texts": ["What is in the image?", "What is AI?"], "images": ["/path/3.png", "/path/4.png"]}
        ]
    }
    ```

    3. Fixed schedule version
    ```json
    {
        "session_id": "session_123",
        "turns": [
            {"timestamp": 0, "text": "What is deep learning?"},
            {"timestamp": 1000, "text": "Who are you?"}
        ]
    }
    ```

    4. Time delayed version
    ```json
    {
        "session_id": "session_123",
        "turns": [
            {"delay": 0, "text": "What is deep learning?"},
            {"delay": 1000, "text": "Who are you?"}
        ]
    }
    ```

    5. full-featured version (multi-batch, multi-modal, multi-fielded, session-based, etc.)
    ```json
    {
        "session_id": "session_123",
        "turns": [
            {
                "timestamp": 1234,
                "texts": [

                    {"name": "text_field_b", "contents": ["hi there"]}
                ],
                "images": [
                    {"name": "image_field_a", "contents": ["/path/1.png", "/path/2.png"]},
                    {"name": "image_field_b", "contents": ["/path/3.png"]}
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    6. persistent system prompt version
    ```json
    {
        "session_id": "session_123",
        "turns": [
            {"role": "system", "text": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"text": "What is deep learning?"},
            {"text": "Explain it for a five year old.", "delay": 1000}
        ]
    }
    ```
    A leading text-only ``role: "system"`` turn is hoisted into the
    conversation-level ``system_message`` rather than dispatched as its own
    (user-less) request. The endpoint then prepends it to every turn's
    message array, so the system prompt persists across all turns and does
    not consume a turn slot or skew per-turn metrics. Hoisting only applies to
    endpoints that send ``system_message`` (chat, responses, messages,
    chat_embeddings); on others the system turn is left in place rather than
    silently dropped. A conversation
    that leads with two or more consecutive ``role: "system"`` turns is
    un-hoisted: the endpoint only merges ``system_message`` into a rendered
    leading system message during warmup, so a hoisted prompt sitting in front
    of another leading system turn would never reach the wire in profiling
    while still counting toward ISL. Both system turns are dispatched normally
    instead, matching pre-hoist behavior.
