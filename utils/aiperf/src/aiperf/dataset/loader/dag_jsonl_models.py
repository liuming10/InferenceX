"""Typed schema for the ``dag_jsonl`` file format.

Each line in a DAG JSONL file validates as a :class:`DagConversation`. Each
turn validates as a :class:`DagTurn`, whose top-level fields map to AIPerf's
native Turn concepts (``messages``, ``model``, ``max_tokens``, ``tools``) plus
three structural scheduling fields (``forks``, ``spawns``, ``delay``). Every
other OpenAI chat-completions or vendor-specific parameter — temperature,
top_p, seed, stop, ignore_eos, min_tokens, etc. — goes in
:attr:`DagTurn.extra`, matching the CLI's ``--extra-inputs`` convention.

Messages are stored as ``list[dict[str, Any]]`` with a lightweight validator
(non-empty, each entry must have a ``role`` key), matching ``MooncakeTrace``.
This leaves multimodal content parts, ``tool_calls``, and any future OpenAI
message shape unconstrained so authors can paste their exact wire body.

Unknown top-level keys on either a conversation or a turn are rejected at
load time so typos surface immediately.

    Symmetric note: ``DagFork.background`` is to FORK what ``DagSpawn.join_at``

    and-forget within the parent's session: child inherits the parent's

    branches support delayed-join — FORK terminates the parent so there is no
    later turn to join on.
