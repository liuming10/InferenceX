"""DAG branch orchestrator.

Intercepts parent-turn completion, dispatches child sessions (FORK or SPAWN
mode), tracks join completion, and releases per-parent state when the DAG
drains. See ``docs/benchmark-modes/dag.md`` for user-facing semantics.

Delayed joins (K>1)
-------------------
A parent may spawn children on turn T whose join fires on turn T+K for any
K>=1. The parent progresses turns T+1..T+K-1 normally while children execute
in parallel, and only suspends on the turn that immediately precedes the
gated turn. This matches the conflux author model and is validated at load
time by ``validate_for_orchestrator_v1``.

Dispatch offsets (SPAWN mode)
-----------------------------
A SPAWN child whose recorded first request starts after the branch spawn
(child turn-0 ``timestamp_ms`` past the branch ``start_timestamp_ms``)
dispatches through the shared replay scheduler at that offset instead of
firing immediately, reproducing the recorded in-subagent timing (e.g. a
weka overflow stream whose first request landed minutes after the subagent
spawned). Join gates and descendant counts are registered before scheduling,
so gated parents wait for delayed children; ``cleanup()`` cancels pending
dispatches. Datasets without timing (``--ignore-trace-delays``) carry None
timestamps and keep the immediate-dispatch behavior.

Sticky-routing locality (FORK mode)
-----------------------------------
FORK-mode children are routed to the parent's worker via the sticky router
(keyed by ``parent_correlation_id``). Because the parent's ``UserSession``
lives in the same worker's local memory, the child's
``UserSessionManager.create_and_store`` can clone ``turn_list`` directly
from the parent session with no cross-process plumbing. The orchestrator
bumps the parent's sticky refcount via
``StickyCreditRouter.register_child_routing`` before dispatching FORK-mode
children and releases it via ``release_child_routing`` when each child
terminates. SPAWN-mode children still carry ``parent_correlation_id`` so
they co-locate on the parent's worker while that sticky entry is live,
but they do not bump sticky refcounts (no ``register_child_routing``).

Credit return flow
------------------
``CreditCallbackHandler.on_credit_return`` processing order::

    1. Atomic counting (progress.increment_returned)
    2. Track prefill release if TTFT never arrived
    3. Release concurrency slots (skipped for children: agent_depth > 0)
    4. DAG child-completion hook (on_child_leaf_reached / on_child_errored
       for final-turn child credits only)
    5. Signal all_credits_returned_event (deferred if DAG has pending work)
    6. intercept(credit): spawn branches declared on the completed turn and
       return True IFF the parent's NEXT turn is a gated turn with
       unsatisfied prereqs.
    7. Strategy dispatch if not intercepted (child bypass uses
       ``agent_depth > 0``)

Stop-condition interaction
--------------------------
Three coordinated guards achieve zero-overshoot, zero-deadlock around DAG
work that outlives the phase's root-sampling completion::

1. **Callback-handler child bypass** (step 7): credit returns carrying
   ``agent_depth > 0`` always reach ``handle_credit_return`` even after
   ``can_send_any_turn`` flips False. Without this, child final returns
   would be silently dropped, leaving parents stuck in ``_active_joins``.

2. **Completion-event deferral** (step 5): when a root's final return is
   about to trigger child dispatch or when the orchestrator still has
   ``has_pending_branch_work()`` (both folded into ``_dag_work_pending``),
   the all-credits-returned event is held until the DAG drains.

3. **Session-slot bypass for children** (``CreditIssuer.issue_credit``):
   children with ``agent_depth > 0`` never acquire a session slot, so the
   callback handler's matching release is gated on ``agent_depth == 0``.
   The two sides are symmetric — see ``credit/issuer.py`` and
   ``credit/callback_handler.py``.

Cleanup
-------
``PhaseRunner`` calls ``cleanup()`` at every phase-exit path. Late credit
returns after cleanup find ``_cleaning_up=True`` and short-circuit without
dispatching new work. ``cleanup()`` logs final ``BranchStats`` and warns
about any leaked per-parent state — normally empty, non-empty indicates a
DAG that failed to drain (worker crash, protocol mismatch, bug).
