"""Out-of-process LCB codegen grading worker.

Runs as ``python -m aiperf.accuracy.graders._codegen_worker``. A fresh,
single-threaded interpreter that forces the ``fork`` start method once at
startup, then reads one JSONL grading request per line from stdin and writes one
JSONL response per line to a private protocol fd. Executing lighteval's
``codegen_metrics`` here (not in the multithreaded record-processor daemon)
avoids both the nested-function pickle failure under spawn/forkserver and the
multithreaded-fork hang. See issue #1145.
