"""Adversarial / pathological end-to-end pins for ``DagFork.background``.

These cases drive the full credit/orchestrator pipeline against fixtures
designed to stress the parts that quietly broke under the v1 design (and
caught the ``root_requests_sent`` counter bug):

  - Nested BG-fork (root → BG fork → A → BG fork → B): does the parent's
    full-turn-list dispatch correctly at every depth?
  - Fan-out BG (root BG-forks 5 children at once): orchestrator must
    track all 5 spawn-and-drain edges concurrently with the parent's
    later turns.
  - BG-fork + SPAWN_JOIN coexistence: parent BG-forks on turn 0
    (fire-and-forget), THEN suspends on a SPAWN_JOIN gate at turn 1, then
    runs turn 2 after the gate fires. Tests the runtime correctly
    distinguishes the two scheduling modes on the same conversation.
  - Concurrency=4 + BG-fork: drain-observer interaction. Multiple BG
    parents in flight, each with their own children fanning out. Pre-fix
    this exposed the same race the dag_hard_cap suite caught."""
