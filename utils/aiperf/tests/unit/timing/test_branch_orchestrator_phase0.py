"""Phase 0 unit tests for :class:`BranchOrchestrator` and :class:`CreditIssuer`.

Covers Phase 0 adjacent bug fixes (still valid under Phase 1's revised
data model):

- ``dispatch_join_turn`` propagates ``parent_branch_mode`` and
  ``parent_has_forks_on_gated_turn`` from :class:`PendingBranchJoin` instead
  of hardcoding FORK.
- ``BranchOrchestrator.intercept`` dispatches the gated join turn immediately
  when every ``start_branch_child`` call fails (no children landed), instead
  of registering a dead pending join that hangs the parent.
